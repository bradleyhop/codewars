My answers to codewars.com's algorithm scripting problems. I'm using this site to practice javascript, problem solving, and learn from other programmers.

My current points and rating level:
![Current Level])(https://www.codewars.com/users/bradleyhop/badges/large)

Here is my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/bradleyhop).

The lower the number, the higher the ranking and the more challenging the problems are.

Each file is formated as such:

```javascript
// Difficulty level in kyu

/*
 * The problem is stated (cut/copy from codewars) at the top of the file.
 */

function algoScript(variable) {
     // the coding itself solving above stated problem.
     // All code is my own work.
     return variable;
}

console.log(algoScript("test conditions"));
// a couple of calls to function with each call's result in a comment directly below
// not all test cases used by codewars are in the files; just enough to get the gist
```
