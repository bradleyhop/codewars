My answers to codewars.com’s algorithm scripting problems. I’m using this site to practice javascript, problem solving, and learn from other programmers. The lower the number, the higher the ranking and the more challenging the problems are. Each problem is in a folder corresponding to its difficulty level.

Here is my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/bradleyhop).

Each file is formatted as such:

```javascript
// Difficulty level in kyu

/*
 * The problem is stated (cut/copy from codewars) at the top of the file.
 */

function algoScript(variable) {
     // the coding itself solving above stated problem.
     // All code is my own work.
     return variable;
}

console.log(algoScript("test conditions"));
// a couple of calls to function with each call's result in a comment directly below
// not all test cases used by codewars are in the files; just enough to get the gist
```
